### Contributing to spocc

1. Fork this repo to your account
2. Clone down to your machine from your account
3. Add an upstream remote for the `ropensci/spocc` repo by doing `git remote add upstream git@github.com:ropensci/spocc.git`
4. Make a new feature branch
5. Make changes
6. Commit those changes and push to your account
7. Send a pull request to `ropensci/spocc`

__Note:__ If you want to contribute to the vignette, or add a new one, those are kept in the `inst/vign/` directory. The main vignette is in `inst/vign/spocc_vignette.Rmd`. The Makefile builds and moves the built vignette to the `vignettes` dir - but don't worry about that.

If you want to submit an issue (bug report/question), then go to the [issues page](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/issues?state=open) and do that.

Thanks for contributing!!!!!
