I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.1 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and WinBuilder.

This is a second re-submission to remove extraneous files. The 
first re-submission was to fix examples that did not run. 

Thanks for your patience! Scott Chamberlain
