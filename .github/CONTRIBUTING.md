### Issues and Pull Requests

If you are considering a pull request, you may want to open an issue first to discuss with the maintainer(s).

### Code contributions

* Fork this repo to your GitHub account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/mapr.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `mapr` at `ropensci/mapr`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ropensci/mapr.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch - see <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/> for how to contribute by branching, making changes, then submitting a pull request)
* Push up to your account
* Submit a pull request to home base (likely master branch, but check to make sure) at `ropensci/mapr`

### Vignette changes

If you want to contribute to the vignette, or add a new one, those are kept in the `inst/vign/` directory. The main vignette is in `inst/vign/mapr_vignette.Rmd`.

### Discussion forum

Check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) if you think your issue requires a longer form discussion.
